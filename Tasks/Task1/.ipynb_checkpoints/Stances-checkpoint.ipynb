    "This is a somewhat interesting result. As we can see, when both fighters use different stances more often than not it is better to prefer  a fighter who uses the southpaw stance instead of a fighter who uses the orthodox stance. The sample size was 1331, which tells us that this is certainly not random occurrence either and there is certainly some kind of correlation.\n",
    "One of the reasons why this might be the case is that vast majority of the population is right handed and because of this most of the time fighters are fighting against other right handed fighters. This means that left handed fighters are probably used to fighting against right handed fighters, but right handed fighters do not get to fight against left handed fighters that often so the situation is less familiar for them."
